It's really hard to come up with background music for youtube videos. With all this copyright thing, your video can get demonetized, your channel can get striked, etc. A great thing though is that there is songs that aren't copyrighted.
Those songs are not exactly hard to find, but they're tedious to download. There's where the software I developed comes in. The idea is quite simple, you give the program a youtube playlist url, and it downloads all the videos.
Since my usage is for youtube background music, I use the playlists of this channel called [Chill out records](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2iczXFcRRg5nN_IVQOXIaA).
Shout out to them, their channel is amazing. It provides great background music, with easy to use artist credit instructions.
